Agile methodologies have gained immense popularity over the last twenty years in software development. Becoming the defacto way for engineering teams to work.

However, there has been a persistent misconception that Governance and Agile are incompatible.

## The Evolution of Governance.

Traditional Governance is associated with bureaucratic processes that hinder innovation and slow decision-making. Governance should be re-framed as an enabler rather than a hindrance to Agile. It provides structure, guidelines, and guardrails to ensure strategic alignment, risk management, and compliance.

## Governance is already in play.

It's worth noting that Governance can also be classified as being internal or external to engineering (or any other team).

Internal Governance can include the cadence and responsibilties relating to standups, line management, acceptibility criteria, and the use of post-mortems.

External Governance can mean company requirements or compliance with regulators.

## IBM's Approach.

IBM recognizes the significance of Agile Governance and has developed a framework called "Agility@Scale." This approach acknowledges the need for governance while embracing Agile development principles.

Agility at Scale tries to enable organisations to strike the right balance between agility and governance by fostering collaboration and innovation at every level.

It emphasizes the importance of alignment, autonomy, and adaptability for every business unit within an organisation, whether that be clinical services, business development or engineering. It promotes the creation of governance systems that are lightweight, flexible, and responsive to change.

## The Benefits of Agile Governance

Agile Governance brings several benefits to organisations:

- Strategic Alignment: Agile Governance ensures that projects and initiatives align with the organisation's strategic objectives, fostering a clearer vision and direction for the entire team.
- Risk Mitigation: Effective governance helps identify and mitigate risks early in the project lifecycle, enabling teams to address potential issues before they become significant problems.
- Compliance and Security: Agile Governance provides a framework for ensuring compliance with regulations and industry standards and maintaining robust security practices.

## Conclusion

The perception of Governance as something to grudgingly comply with is changing.

Startups and scale-ups are beginning to recognise the value of an agile approach to governance. When implemented flexibly and adaptively, governance becomes an enabler rather than a series of gates.
