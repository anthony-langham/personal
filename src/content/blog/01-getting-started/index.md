## My Philosophy

I see my work as a doctor and engineer as a form of **entropy reversal** — taking chaotic, ambiguous, or disordered systems and bringing structure, clarity, and direction.

Whether I’m shaping clinical workflows, designing product logic, or building tools, the drive is the same: **convert noise into signal**.

## How I Reverse Entropy

### In Clinic

- Triage ambiguity into structured decision-making
- Translate symptoms into diagnoses, plans, outcomes
- Reduce risk, uncertainty, and emotional distress

### In the Terminal

- Turn vague requirements into buildable code
- Reduce user friction with clean, fast interfaces
- Ship tools that improve signal density (like TMDR)

### In Strategy

- Shape problems so teams know what to build
- Bridge clinical nuance with product constraints
- Design systems that reduce entropy over time, not amplify it

## Why It Matters

Entropy isn’t just physics — it’s in every broken spec, every missed edge case, every bloated clinical system.

My work is about **reversing that trend**:

- Fewer steps
- Clearer logic
- Safer care
- Better outcomes

Entropy rises unless someone actively reduces it. That’s the role I play.

## Closing

I don’t just want to help. I want to structure.  
I don’t just want to advise. I want to design.  
I don’t just want to be involved. I want to **reduce entropy**.
