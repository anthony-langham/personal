Entropy in systems thinking isn't about thermodynamics, its about drift. It concerns a the gradual decline into disorder of a system over time without ongoing input and energy to prevent this. Technical dependencies become unsupported, security fixes are required, documentation becomes out of date.

My work as a doctor and clinical product manager is a form of **local entropy reversal** taking chaotic, ambiguous, or disordered systems and applying energy efficiently to restore structure.

Whether I’m designing clinical service pathways, building clinical product logic, the drive is the same: **convert noise into signal**.

### In Clinic

- Convert ambiguity into structured decision-making.
- Translate symptoms into diagnoses, plans, and outcomes.
- Reduce risk, uncertainty, and adverse outcomes for patients.

### In Development

- Create clear requirements from ambiguous solutions.
- Reduce user friction with clean, fast interfaces
- Ship tools that improve clarity (like [tmdr](https://www.tmdr.sh))

### In Strategy

- Clearly define problems and hypotheses so teams are aligned.
- Bridge clinical experience with product and technical constraints.
- Design systems that control system entropy over time, not amplify it.

## Why It Matters

Entropy isn’t confined to physics, it’s in every broken spec, every missed edge case, and every disease process.

My work is about trying to **reverse those trends**:

- Safer care
- Better outcomes
- Clearer logic
- Fewer steps

Entropy continues to increase unless someone actively reduces it. That’s the role I try to play in my work.
