## Joy Milne

Joy is a retired nurse from Perth, Scotland. And she has an incredible skill; she can smell Parkinson‚Äôs disease.

Yep, that‚Äôs right, she can ==**_smell_**== Parkinson‚Äôs disease.

## What‚Äôs Parkinson‚Äôs Disease?

    Parkinson‚Äôs Disease is a degenerative neurological disorder that presents slowly with a tremor, muscle rigidity, slowness, and increasing difficulty walking.

As the disease progresses it often causes depression anxiety and dementia.

The root cause of the disease isn‚Äôt completely understood. But it‚Äôs likely to be a combination of environmental exposure and genetic susceptibility.

We do know that there is a loss of nerve cells in part of the brain called the _substantia negra_, which is responsible for the creation of a chemical called _dopamine_.

    Dopamine is the neurotransmitter that motivates behaviour, and is involved in regulating movement. (Dopamine also causes the feeling you get when your social media posts get likes üòâ).

There‚Äôs no cure for Parkinson‚Äôs but there are treatments to reduce the symptoms.

Medications such as levodopa replace the missing dopamine. There‚Äôs also a surgical treatment called Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) which stimulates the brain to make more dopamine.

It‚Äôs a common disease, with 1 in 500 people being affected.

## Joy & Les

Joy was married to Les, a Consultant Anaesthetist in the NHS.

He was diagnosed with Parkinson‚Äôs disease at the age of 45, which is younger than average.

Most people are diagnosed over the age of 60, but about 1 in 20 people are diagnosed with Parkinson‚Äôs under the age of 40.

Les passed away in 2015.

Several years before Les was diagnosed with the condition, Joy noticed something strange. He started to smell different. Joy describes it as an unpleasant ‚Äòmusky‚Äô smell. She didn‚Äôt think anything of it at the time.

It wasn‚Äôt until she attended a Parkinson‚Äôs event with Les many years later that she noticed that she could smell that same musky odour on many of the other people with the disease.

Joy reached out to Dr Tilo Kunath at the university Edinburgh and shared her experience, not knowing what he would think.

Dr Kunath was initially skeptical

> **‚ÄúIt just didn‚Äôt seem possible. Why should Parkinson‚Äôs have an odour?‚Äù** - Dr Kunath

He later changed his mind when he learnt that dogs can smell biomarkers for lung cancer at the 2019 _Experimental Biology_ meeting. He contacted Joy and agreed to set up an experiment.

## The Experiment

Dr Kunath designed a simple experiment to test Whether Joy really could smell Parkinson‚Äôs.

They recruited 6 people with Parkinson‚Äôs and 6 people without (the ‚Äòcontrol‚Äô group).

They asked these 12 people to wear a t-shirt for the day and then drop it off at the lab. Joy was then asked to smell it and decide whether the wearer had the disease or not.

## The results

The results were **_incredible._** Joy almost got a perfect score. Out of the 12 T-shirt‚Äôs, she was correct on 11 of them.

The only error was a false positive - she identified one of the control group as having Parkinson‚Äôs, when they didn‚Äôt.

**_But Joyce was actually correct_**

That person in the control group was diagnosed with Parkinson‚Äôs 3 months later.

> **‚ÄùShe was telling us this individual had Parkinson‚Äôs before he knew, before anybody knew,‚Äù** - Dr Kunath

In 2019 they published a scientific paper together, again with a Parkinson‚Äôs group and control group. Joy could definitely smell Parkinson‚Äôs. The sweat seemed to have characteristic patterns of compounds on mass spectrometry.

## Further Work

Dr Kunath approached Dr Barran of the University of Manchester to try to isolate the specific compounds causing the smell.

They ran a larger trial using more sophisticated mass spectrometry:[Sebum: A Window into Dysregulation of Mitochondrial Metabolism in Parkinson‚Äôs Disease](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/60c74d3bf96a0010de2878e1) which was funded by a Michael J. Fox research grant

They found 10 compounds linked to Parkinson‚Äôs disease.

## The future

At the time of writing (July 2021), doctors still diagnose the condition in the same way as Dr James Parkinson did in his 1817 [essay](https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/An_Essay_on_the_Shaking_Palsy.html?id=GB4-AQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button&newbks=1&newbks_redir=1&redir_esc=y).

Further research does need to be carried out to convert this discovery into a non-invasive test for Parkinson‚Äôs. But just imagine, in the not too distant future, a patient could have a simple swab taken of their skin and analysed to tell them if they have Parkinson‚Äôs.

This wouldn‚Äôt have been possible without Joy Milne and her ‚Äòsuper-smeller‚Äô nose.
