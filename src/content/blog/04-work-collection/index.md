Agile methodologies have gained immense popularity over the last twenty years in software development and project management. Agile frameworks such as Kanban, Scrum and CD/CI revolutionized how teams collaborate, iterate, and deliver value. However, there has been a persistent misconception that Governance and 'Agile' are incompatible. This notion is being updated as organisations realize the necessity for Agile Governance in achieving business success, no more so than in the healthtech sector. In this post, we will explore why Governance is not, in fact, an Agile swear word, how IBM's agility@scale, and the work from Disciplined Agile support this paradigm shift.

The Evolution of Governance.
Traditional Governance has been associated with heavy-handed, bureaucratic processes that hindered innovation and slowed decision-making, often using command and control tactics. However, as businesses face increasing market volatility and competitive pressures, the need for good governance hasn't diminished; it has increased. Governance should be seen as an enabler rather than a hindrance to Agile practices. It provides structure, guidelines, and guardrails to ensure strategic alignment, risk management, and compliance.

Governance is already in play.
It's worth noting that Governance can also be classified as being internal or external to engineering teams (or any other team). Internal Governance can include the cadence and responsibilties relating to standups, line managment, the acceptibility criteria of linters, and the use of post-mortems. External Governance can mean organisational requirements, or regulatory compliance.
IBM's Approach.
IBM recognizes the significance of Agile Governance and has developed a framework called "Agility at Scale." This approach acknowledges the need for governance while embracing Agile development principles. Agility at Scale enables organisations to strike the right balance between agility and governance, fostering collaboration and innovation at every level.
IBM's framework emphasizes the importance of alignment, autonomy, and adaptability for every business unit within an organisation, whether that be clinical services, business development or engineering. It promotes the creation of governance systems that are lightweight, flexible, and responsive to change. By leveraging Agile practices, such as iterative planning, frequent feedback loops, and continuous improvement, IBM demonstrates that governance can coexist harmoniously with Agile principles.
The Disciplined Agile Mindset
Disciplined Agile (DA), another comprehensive Agile framework, further supports the notion that Governance and Agile Software Development can go hand in hand. DA provides a mindset, a toolkit, and a framework to help organizations make better decisions and navigate complex governance challenges. It acknowledges that governance is necessary for any organization but emphasizes the need to tailor it to specific contexts.
The key to success lies in adopting a pragmatic and outcome-oriented approach to governance. Disciplined Agile promotes governance activities that add value, eliminate waste, and empower teams. It encourages organizations to focus on outcomes rather than processes, enabling teams to make autonomous decisions while adhering to strategic goals and compliance requirements.
The Benefits of Agile Governance
Agile Governance brings several benefits to organisations:
Strategic Alignment: Agile Governance ensures that projects and initiatives align with the organisation's strategic objectives, fostering a clearer vision and direction for the entire team.
Risk Mitigation: Effective governance helps identify and mitigate risks early in the project lifecycle, enabling teams to address potential issues before they become significant problems.
Compliance and Security: Agile Governance provides a framework for ensuring compliance with regulations and industry standards and maintaining robust security practices.
Empowered Teams: Organisations using Agile Governance should empower teams to make informed decisions, collaborate, and take ownership of their work, enhancing motivation and engagement.
Continuous Improvement: Agile Governance encourages a culture of learning and continuous improvement, enabling organizations to adapt to market changes, customer feedback, and emerging opportunities.
Conclusion
The perception of Governance as an Agile swear word, or something to grudgingly comply with is changing rapidly. Startups are recognising the value of Agile Governance. When implemented flexibly and adaptively, governance becomes an enabler for Agile Methodologies rather than a series of gates. By embracing Agile governance, organisations can align strategic goals, mitigate risks, and ensure compliance which is a prerequisite for healtech environments.
