Status
🚀 Core System Operational - Hybrid graph-based retrieval system with monitoring

✅ Completed Phases
Project Setup: Repository, structure, Python environment
MongoDB Atlas: Database setup, collections, SSL-secured connections
Web Scraping: NICE content scraping, chunking, deduplication
Graph Building: LangChain integration, medical entity extraction
Vector Store: MongoDB Atlas vector search with OpenAI embeddings
Retrieval System: Hybrid graph-first retrieval with vector fallback
Monitoring: Comprehensive metrics tracking for performance and costs
QA Chain: Complete question-answering system with clinical safety prompting
Answer Formatting: Confidence scoring and provenance tracking
Answer Validation: Hallucination detection and source verification
Unit Testing: Comprehensive test suite with 59 passing tests and TDD approach
🎯 Current Capabilities
Enhanced Data Pipeline: NICE Guidelines → Advanced Medical Knowledge Graph → Hybrid Retrieval → QA Chain
Clinical Question Answering: GPT-4o-mini powered QA with medical safety prompting
Hybrid Retrieval: Graph-first approach with intelligent vector search fallback
Source Attribution: Complete provenance tracking with confidence scoring
Performance Monitoring: Track retrieval latency, costs, and usage patterns
Cost Tracking: Token-based estimation for OpenAI API usage
Interactive Graph Visualization: Neo4j-style network explorer with color-coded entities and relationships
Analytics Dashboard: Comprehensive network statistics, entity distributions, and graph metrics
Clinical Decision Trees: Age-based, ethnicity-based, and conditional treatment pathways
Advanced Entity Extraction: 20+ entity types including Drug*Class, Age_Criteria, Treatment_Algorithm
Treatment Relationships: FIRST_LINE_FOR, IF_NOT_TOLERATED, CONDITIONAL_ON pathway logic
SSL Security: MongoDB Atlas connections secured and operational
Graph Storage: Persistent medical knowledge graphs in MongoDB
Management Scripts: Comprehensive suite for graph building, data management, and analysis
Test Coverage: Full LLM mocking and dependency injection for reliable testing
📋 Next Steps
TASK-032: Lambda function structure for API development
TASK-030: Validation suite with golden queries and benchmarks
TASK-031: Integration testing for end-to-end flow validation
TASK-061: Granular source attribution for paragraph-level precision
