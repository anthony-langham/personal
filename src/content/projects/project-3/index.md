## Overview

An intelligent clinical decision support system that leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to provide structured, auditable clinical recommendations. The system ingests unstructured clinical notes and generates evidence-based treatment plans with precise medication dosing calculations.

## üéØ Core Features

- Clinical Note Parsing: Extracts structured patient data from unstructured text
- Condition Identification: Matches symptoms and assessments to medical conditions
- Medication Dosing: Calculates weight-based doses with safety constraints
- Treatment Planning: Generates comprehensive, evidence-based treatment plans
- Audit Trail: Provides transparent, reproducible clinical reasoning

## üè• Supported Conditions

- Pediatric Croup (Laryngotracheobronchitis)
- Adult Acute Asthma (Bronchospasm)
- COPD Exacerbation (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease)
- Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP)
- Paediatric Gastroenteritis (Dehydration management)

## Why MCP over RAG?

- Deterministic Results: Medical decisions require reproducible, auditable outputs
- Structured Validation: Medical data needs strict input/output validation
- Performance: Direct tool calls are faster than semantic search
  Safety: Explicit logic is safer than AI interpretation for medical calculations
- Transparency: Clear reasoning chain for clinical decisions

## Why JSON Files over Database?

- Simplicity: No database setup/configuration for MVP
- Version Control: Clinical data tracked in git with code
- Performance: Fast file reads from Lambda filesystem
- Cost: No database costs for MVP
- Development Speed: Instant data updates without deployment
